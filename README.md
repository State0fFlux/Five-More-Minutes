# Five More Minutes

**Five More Minutes** is a dream-logic time puzzle where you’re stuck in the endless loop of alarm-snoozing. As sheep leap over the fence in your half-conscious mind, each one skips time forward — but not evenly. It’s your job to listen for audio cues, decipher time patterns, and decide which sheep to let through… and which ones to brutally eject from dreamland.

## Game Overview
- **Genre**: Puzzle, experimental, audio-based
- **Concept**: Alter the actions in your dream to stay asleep long enough to make it to 8:00AM, and to wake up promptly.
- **Goal**: Wake up in time for your final at 8:00AM!

## Features
- Unique alert system where each sheep variant plays a different chime, hinting at the time skip they’ll cause.
- Limited “wake-ups” that let you peek at your real-world phone time — but burn battery life and bring you closer to missing your day entirely.
- Moral ambiguity! How many poor lambs must suffer to get you to class at the right time?

## Technology Stack
